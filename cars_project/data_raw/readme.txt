Title: Motor Trend Car Road Tests

Description: The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

Usage: mtcars

Format: A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

[, 1] 	mpg 	Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2] 	cyl 	Number of cylinders
[, 3] 	disp 	Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4] 	hp 	Gross horsepower
[, 5] 	drat 	Rear axle ratio
[, 6] 	wt 	Weight (1000 lbs)
[, 7] 	qsec 	1/4 mile time
[, 8] 	vs 	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
[, 9] 	am 	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10] 	gear 	Number of forward gears
[,11] 	carb 	Number of carburetors

Note: Henderson and Velleman (1981) comment in a footnote to Table 1: ‘Hocking [original transcriber]'s noncrucial coding of the Mazda's rotary engine as a straight six-cylinder engine and the Porsche's flat engine as a V engine, as well as the inclusion of the diesel Mercedes 240D, have been retained to enable direct comparisons to be made with previous analyses.’

Examples:

require(graphics)
pairs(mtcars, main = "mtcars data", gap = 1/4)
coplot(mpg ~ disp | as.factor(cyl), data = mtcars,
       panel = panel.smooth, rows = 1)
## possibly more meaningful, e.g., for summary() or bivariate plots:
mtcars2 <- within(mtcars, {
   vs <- factor(vs, labels = c("V", "S"))
   am <- factor(am, labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
   cyl  <- ordered(cyl)
   gear <- ordered(gear)
   carb <- ordered(carb)
})
summary(mtcars2)
